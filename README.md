# Birthdate-Sorter
This python program was just a way for me to practice some parts of python that I thought I needed to learn. I used lists, for loops, nested for loops, else if, if statements, and a few others that are even more basic. 

In order to see the program work, simply paste the python code into a python 3 IDE and run the code. The program is a bit finnicky about inputs, so here are some instructions on how to input data.

-Only input months with a capital first letter and lowercase for the rest, for example "January"

-Ensure spelling is correct on the month, as an error will occour with typos.

-For the day of the month, separate the day from the month with a single space, and enter the number, for example "January 1"

If the program is working correctly, after entering the first input, it will prompt you for the next one. Use the same formatting as the first input. Input five birthdates, and the program should output the dates in chronological order.
